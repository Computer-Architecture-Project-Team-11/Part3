## First Section 

1. Powers:
   - > **Dynamic Power**: the power comsumed while the inputs are active. While active switching of transistors occurs, meaning the switch of a gate (0 to 1, 1 to 0), the capacitor is charging and discharging. The required energy for the procedure causes the dissipation of the dynamic power. It depends on the capacitance of the transistors, the frequency of switching and the activity level. 
   - > **Leakage** : the power consumed while the circuit is inactive is the static power. At this state, leakage of the transistors occurs. Leak-
age current depends on the width of the transistors and the local state of the devices. There are two types of leakage, the subthreshold and the gate leakage. Subthreshold leakage is related to the source an drain while the gate leakage is related to current leaking through the gate.
